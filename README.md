`There! little girl; don't cry!
They have broken your doll, I know;
And your tea-set blue,
And your play-house, too,
Are things of the long ago;
But childish troubles will soon pass by.
There! little girl; don't cry!`

```
There! little girl; don't cry!
They have broken your slate, I know;
And the glad, wild ways
Of your schoolgirl days
Are things of the long ago;
But life and love will soon come by.
There! little girl; don't cry!
```


~~There! little girl; don't cry!~~
**They have broken your heart I know;**
**And the _rainbow_ gleams**
Of your youthful dreams
*Are things of the long ago;*
But Heaven holds all for which you sigh.
There! little girl; don't cry!
